# City Garbage Management System using Van Tracking

## Project Overview
The **City Garbage Management System** is a smart solution designed to optimize waste collection and management in urban areas. The system uses van tracking technology to monitor garbage collection vehicles, ensuring efficient routing and timely waste collection. This project aims to address urban waste management challenges by improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.

## Features
- **Real-time Van Tracking**: Monitor the location of garbage collection vans in real-time using GPS technology.
- **Route Optimization**: Use algorithms to determine the most efficient routes for waste collection, minimizing fuel consumption and time.
- **Waste Collection Scheduling**: Schedule and manage waste collection times and routes.
- **Data Visualization**: Provide visual insights into waste collection patterns and operational efficiency using interactive maps and charts.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Send alerts for vehicle maintenance, route deviations, and schedule changes.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **GPS Tracking**: Integration with GPS hardware for real-time location tracking
- **Data Visualization**: React Leaflet, Chart.js
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## System Architecture
1. **Frontend**: The user interface developed using React provides an interactive dashboard for monitoring and managing waste collection operations. Features include real-time van tracking on maps and data visualizations.
2. **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js handle server-side logic, including processing data from GPS devices, managing user requests, and interacting with the database.
3. **Database**: MongoDB stores information related to van locations, waste collection schedules, and historical data.
4. **GPS Tracking**: Integration with GPS hardware allows real-time tracking of garbage collection vans and updating their locations in the system.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) database
- [GPS Tracking Device](https://www.example.com/gps-device) (if using real GPS data)

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerTabish/city-garbage-management-system.git
    cd city-garbage-management-system
    ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Configure database connection in `config.js`:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       db: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/garbage_management'
     };
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible at the specified URI.
   - Import any initial data if necessary.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app version of the system for field staff to access real-time data and manage tasks on the go.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate advanced analytics and machine learning to predict waste generation patterns and optimize routes further.
- **Integration with Smart Bins**: Incorporate data from smart bins to provide real-time fill levels and adjust collection schedules accordingly.
